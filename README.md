# AI Doctor 🏥🤖

AI Doctor is an AI-powered web application that enables users to upload images of skin lesions and provide optional textual descriptions of their symptoms. The application utilizes deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis, to accurately predict skin diseases.

## 🌟 Objective  
The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly AI-based medical assistant that helps in the early detection of skin diseases, providing quick and reliable assessments.

## 🔑 Key Features  
- 📸 **Image Upload:** Users can upload images of their skin conditions for analysis.  
- ✍️ **Text Description:** Optional text input allows users to describe symptoms for better predictions.  
- 🔬 **Disease Prediction:** The AI model predicts the skin disease based on image and text input.  
- 💬 **Ask a Doctor:** Instead of an AI chatbot, users can chat with real doctors for expert advice.  
- 📜 **View Previous Records:** Keeps track of patient records for future reference and medical consultation.  
- ⭐ **User Feedback:** Users can provide feedback to improve model accuracy over time.  

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes  
- A web application that delivers quick and reliable skin disease predictions.  
- Increased accessibility to dermatological assessments for people with limited access to healthcare professionals.  
- A foundation for AI-driven healthcare solutions with continuous improvements.
